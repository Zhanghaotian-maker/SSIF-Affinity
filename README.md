# SSF-Affinity: Multimodal Deep Learning of Sequence-Structure Features for Precise Protein-Protein Binding Affinity Prediction

## Background

Quantitative prediction of binding affinity in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is critical for deciphering biological mechanisms and advancing therapeutic antibody development. While experimental methods for measuring binding affinity remain limited by high-cost, low-throughput constraints, deep learning offers a promising alternative. Currently, the accuracy of models based on deep learning for predicting protein-protein complex binding affinity is limited. This study proposes SSF-Affinity, a novel framework that integrates multimodal deep learning strategies to achieve high-precision affinity predictions by fusing global sequence features with local atomic-level structural information.The evaluation of the PDBbind benchmark dataset indicates that SSF-Affinity significantly outperforms existing advanced models. Specifically, this framework effectively reduces redundant computations and noise interference by combining regional atomic selection strategies, and overcomes the limitations of unimodal methods that use only sequence or structural information through a synergistic representation mechanism of sequence and structural features, effectively balancing the contributions of interface interactions and long-range interactions. The case studies on antibody-antigen complexes further validates the model's generalization ability. SSF-Affinity provides a new strategy for predicting binding affinity in protein-protein complexes, offering a new paradigm for AI-driven antibody drug discovery.
